# Given a strictly sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m and a number x. Find whether the number x is present in the matrix or not.
# Note: In a strictly sorted matrix, each row is sorted in strictly increasing order, and the first element of the ith row (i!=0) is greater than the last element of the (i-1)th row.

# Examples:

# Input: mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9], [14, 20, 21], [30, 34, 43]], x = 14
# Output: true
# Explanation: 14 is present in the matrix, so output is true.
# Input: mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9, 11], [14, 20, 21, 26], [30, 34, 43, 50]], x = 42
# Output: false
# Explanation: 42 is not present in the matrix.
# Input: mat[][] = [[87, 96, 99], [101, 103, 111]], x = 101
# Output: true
# Explanation: 101 is present in the matrix.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n, m <= 1000
# 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 109
# 1 <= x <= 109

# Expected Complexities
# Time Complexity: O(log(nÃ—m))
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)
